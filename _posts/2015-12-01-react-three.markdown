title: React Three
description: A Simplified 3D
---

My only experience with 3D rendering is from my school projects years ago.
I coded a [Wolfenstein3D](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein_3D) using ray-casting, as well as a project using OpenGL in C++ (mostly by copying and pasting code) back in high school.

Since then, I have wanted to check out WebGL, but was not motivated enough to jump into all the calculations it would entail.

When I started to play with React Native I learned there was also an implementation for [Three.js](http://threejs.org/). Once I tried it I was surprised how easy it was to create shapes.

Here is an example of a quick and dirty sandbox app:
