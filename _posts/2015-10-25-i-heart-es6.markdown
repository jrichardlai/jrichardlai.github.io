I came back to JavaScript world after mostly working in backend for the last years at [TaskRabbit](http://www.taskrabbit.com), I was impressed by how much this World changed.

I can say now that I came to **love JavaScript as much as Ruby**.

I enjoyed using CoffeeScript, I know that a lot of the pure JS developers I know were not a fond of it because the sugar syntax gets confusing and because of the gotchas of the `var` statement.

I admit that it did feel like another language to learn:

* You'd have to be careful of spaces.
* You don't really know how the code will look like after it has been compiled.

### ES6

EcmaScript is the Standardized Scripting Language that JavaScript implements.
[ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) (also known as ES2015) is the new version following ES5.

Within one hour of playing and reading about it, I got really excited, this really feels like improvements that I was waiting for in JavaScript.
It is more expressive and encourage functional programming, lots of JavaScript boilerplate is removed.

Here are some of my favorite features:

* Classes
* Fat Arrow (autobinding)
* Promises
* Template strings
* Function parameters default values
* Spread
* Destructing objects

&nbsp;

You can use ES6 right now using [babel](https://babeljs.io/).

ES7 is still in draft and it features decorators and static properties which for me really completes the classes from ES6.
