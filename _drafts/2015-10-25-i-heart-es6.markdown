I came back to JavaScript world after mostly working in backend for the last years at TaskRabbit, I was impressed by how much this World changed.

I can say now that I came to **love** JavaScript as much as Ruby.

I enjoyed using CoffeeScript, I know that a lot of the pure js developer I know were not a fond of it because of the syntax sugar that gets confusing, and of the gotchas of the `var` declaration.
I admit that it did feel like another language to learn:
* you'd have to be careful of spaces
* you don't really know how the code will look like after it has been compiled

ES6 really feels like improvements that I was waiting for in JavaScript.
You can use ES6 right now using babel https://babeljs.io/.
