I have been using a linter since 2 months ago, I can't believe how I could work without using one.

It's not just about prettiness of the code but also make your code more safe and reliable.

By using a linter you can catch even before saving a file syntax errors and code that could become problematic (unused variables, )

I am using it for projects where I work alone but its even more powerful when people are using it together, because the readability and convention is shared.

Sometimes I ask myself if I like a space here or not, and having it written down and making a software tell you what is correct and not remove this cognitive process, which save you lots of milli.

And if you do want to change your rule, then aslant allow you to just run a command to fix it.

I am feeling uneasy when I see that some code is wrong.

This also brought discussion with my coworker about what style of coding they like.

My personal vision is that I'm trying to always have less *git changes*, what I mean by that is that I like having unit changes when changing a line

I like comma dangle and preposition of || and &&

`example here`
